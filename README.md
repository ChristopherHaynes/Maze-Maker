# Maze-Maker
Generates square mazes of variable size using a range of different graph theory generation techniques including recursive backtracking, randomised Prim's, Kruskal's and Eller's algorithms. The resulting mazes can then be saved as bitmap images for use with other programs.

## Maze Generation Algorithms
In total this program currently supports four different generation algorithms:
* Recursive Backtracking
* Prim's Algorithm
* Kruskal's Algoirthm
* Eller's Algorithm

## Possible Further Expansion
* It would be good to add the option to generate GIFs or videos of the generation procedure instead of just bitmaps.
* Expanding the program to also solve generated mazes, using a range of different approaches, would be a useful major expansion.
